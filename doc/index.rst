Welcome to splinart's documentation!
====================================

splinart is a package used for a tutorial which explains how to do the Python packaging using

- `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_
- `conda build <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/recipe.html>`_
- `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_
- `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_
- `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_

And automate the process to distribute this package using github.

The original idea of splinart is found on the great invonvergent website.
